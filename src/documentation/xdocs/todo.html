	<h1>Roadmap</h1>
	
	<h3>Version 1.6.0 (Due December 2020)</h3>

	<p>The focus of this next version is the web front end. We'll have the ability to
	configure Oddjob and we'll switch to Web Sockets for updates for a smoother
	experience.</p>

	<h3>And Then</h3>

	<p>The following version will be all about the Cloud and containerisation. We're
	running Oddjob on AWS, but we'll add GPC and Azure. We'll also containerise it.</p>
