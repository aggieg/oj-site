<body>

	<h1>To Do</h1>
	
	<h3>Version 1.5.0 (Due Spring 2015)</h3>
	
	<ul>		
		<li>Move to Java 1.8.
		</li>
		
		<li>Re do the web interface. Replace the current JSF implementation 
		with a JSON web service and a Java Script client. Include Jetty
		so no separate deployment is necessary.
		</li>	
	</ul>
		
	<h3>As Yet Unscheduled</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Convert documentation into DocBook so it can be
		available in PDF and as a single HTML.
		</li>
		
		<li>Use The idea of flavours introduced for services 
		for the supported tags in Oddjob Designer. At the moment a date can be 
		assigned to an XML field because they are both strings. There 
		should be string flavours 'xml' and 'date'. This should probably 
		also be incorporated into support for JSR330 Qualifiers.
		</li>
		
		<li>Improve all Oddjob's file jobs (copy, rename, delete etc.)
		and include filtering and selection as offered by Ant.</li>
	
		<li>Create a Web integration Oddball. Include the ability to 
		download files and invoke Web Services from Oddjob.</li>
		
		<li>Look at persisting log messages as part of Oddjob's persistence 
		framework so they can be retrieved by an 
		<a href="http://rgordon.co.uk/oddjob/reference/org/oddjob/persist/ArchiveBrowserJob.html">archive-browser</a>.
		</li>
		
		<li>Create an SSH Oddball including both shell and file transfer 
		capabilities.</li>
		
		<li>Investigate Oddjob queue integration. A nice and easy way 
		to distribute Oddjob work would be to have a central producer queue
		Oddjob configurations for distributed slave processes to consume and
		execute.</li>
		
		<li>Look at implementing something akin to Ant Macros in Oddjob.</li>
		
		<li>Look at incorporating Expression Language into Oddjob for 
		attribute configuration.</li>
	</ul>
