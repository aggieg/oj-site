		<p>Oddjob Explorer showing the Job State Summary Tab. The left panel 
		contains a tree view of all the jobs. The right panel shows the
		state summary for the selected job. The job is in an Exception
		state. The stack trace is provided for more information on the
		cause of the exception. There is more information on job states in the 
		<a href="userguide/beginning.html#state">User Guide</a></p>

		<p>Oddjob Explorer showing the Log Tab. Oddjob captures log output 
		from each component separately. The log panel shows just the selected 
		job's log messages. This screenshot is a bit dated as Oddjob now also 
		has a console panel that displays a process's console output. Log
		and Console messages are also captured across the network so you can
		always see what your jobs are up to.</p>

			alt="Oddjob Explorer showing properties on the server."
			height="250" width="380"/></a>
		
		<p>Oddjob Explorer showing the Properties Tab. Oddjob inspects a job's
		Java Bean properties and displays them in this tab. Properties are
		also reflected across the network. Here the properties of Oddjob's
		Over Night Build scheduler can be seen. The overnight build is 
		running on the Linux server 'rob5'. You can see from the job tree
		in the left panel how Oddjob allows both local and remote jobs to
		be monitored and controlled from one place.</p>

		</a>
		
		<p>Oddjob Designer showing a component's configuration. No need to 
		edit XML to configure Oddjob. Oddjob configuration is just as easy
		for jobs on the server. To move jobs just drag them about in the
		tree view on the left. You can also drag/cut/copy and paste jobs
		from Oddjob explorer, even to and from or within the server.</p>

		<p>Oddjob Designer showing the components as XML. For those that like
		XML. The editor isn't great, you might prefer to copy and paste
		the XML to and from the XML editor of your choice.</p>
