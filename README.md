#Oddjob Site

These are the raw files for Oddjob's website at http://rgordon.co.uk/oddjob.

The site is built by applying an XSLT transformation to plain xhtml pages to
provide the consistent side bar and banner. 

I've been using this technique for 20 years now which is probably why
the site looks a little dated.
